================================================

This directory contains a modified version of the Timmes EOS, which we
use for the electron, positron, and photon contributions. The source
files are needed by the SNA and MERGE parts of the SRO EOS, but there
is no standalone executable.

The reference for the Timmes EOS is Timmes & Arnett 1999, ApJS,
